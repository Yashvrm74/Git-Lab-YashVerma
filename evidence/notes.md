# Notes - Git Essentials Assignment

- Learned how to create and switch branches using git switch -c.
- Made two clean commits: feat: add profile file and chore: add contributors list.
- Simulated a merge conflict in README.md between main and feat/profile.
- Resolved the conflict manually using vi, combined both versions as 'Project: A & B'.
- Created a signed-off commit and annotated tag (v0.1.0).
- Maintained a clean git log and status at the end.
